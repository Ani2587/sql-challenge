# sql-challenge
## Overview:
This challenge is divided into three phasesâ€”data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. It begins with inspecting CSV files and creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize data relationships. Following that, participants design a table schema, incorporating primary and foreign keys, data types, and constraints for six CSV files. The final phase involves executing SQL queries to derive specific insights from the dataset, assessing the ability to extract meaningful information for decision-making.

## Purpose:
The challenge aims assessment of skills in data modeling, engineering, and analysis. It evaluates the perception capabilities of data relationships through ERD creation; data engineering proficiency through construction of a well-defined SQL schema; and the ability to extract targeted insights using SQL queries. This multifaceted challenge replicates real-world scenarios, evaluating competency in handling data from conceptualization to practical analysis within a relational database context.

## Instructions: 
Follow these steps to execute the SQL queries successfully:

  1. Copy the 'sql-challenge' folder to your local directory.
  2. Create a new database named '<sql_challenge>'.
  3. Navigate to Tables -> right-click -> Query Tool.
  4. Upload the file "EmployeeSQL/SQL_challenge.sql" to pgAdmin.
  5. Select lines 6-75 and execute. This action will create all six tables.
  6. Modify the path to the CSV files for lines 79-84.All csv files are in Resources folder.
  7. Select lines 79-84 and execute. This will import the CSV data into their respective tables in the specified order.
  8. Execute each query.
  9. The output data of all eight queries are stored in CSV files within the output folder.
